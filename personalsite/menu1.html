         <p> 1Prepare the Ingredients: Gather all the ingredients needed for the curry, including chicken pieces, onions, garlic, ginger, tomatoes, spices (such as turmeric, cumin, coriander, garam masala), and any additional vegetables you want to include.

            Marinate the Chicken (optional): Marinate the chicken pieces with yogurt, lemon juice, salt, and spices for at least 30 minutes to enhance flavor and tenderness.
            
            Saute the Aromatics: Heat oil or ghee in a large skillet or pot over medium heat. Add chopped onions, garlic, and ginger, and saut√© until they turn golden brown and fragrant.
            
            Add Spices: Add ground spices such as turmeric, cumin, coriander, and chili powder to the skillet. Stir well to coat the aromatics and toast the spices for a minute to release their flavors.

        <p>
            Cook the Chicken: Add the marinated chicken pieces to the skillet and cook until they are lightly browned on all sides.
            
            Add Tomatoes: Add chopped tomatoes or tomato puree to the skillet and cook until they break down and become soft, forming a thick sauce.
            
            Simmer: Add water or chicken broth to the skillet to create the desired consistency of the curry. Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and let the curry simmer for about 20-30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender.
            
            Adjust Seasoning: Taste the curry and adjust the seasoning as needed, adding more salt, spices, or chili powder to suit your taste preferences.
            
            Finish with Garnishes: Garnish the chicken curry with fresh cilantro leaves or chopped coriander for added freshness and flavor.
            
            Serve: Serve the chicken curry hot with rice, naan bread, or roti for a complete and satisfying meal.
